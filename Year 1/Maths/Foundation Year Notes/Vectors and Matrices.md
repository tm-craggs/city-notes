Scalars
- Scalars only have magnitude (length, time, temperature)

Vectors
- Have magnitude and direction (acceleration)
- Vectors are represented (a,b) where a is the x displacement from the origin, and b is the y displacement
- Vectors can be multiplied by scalars. For example v = (a.b) x s = 2 v x s = (2a, 2b)
- The magnitude of a vector is calculated with Pythagoras Theorem.  Square both vectors, add them, then square root it. 
- Dot product. Times each item in a vector with the same index in the other vector, then add

Matrix

- Matrix is like a group of vectors
- Individual items are called elements or entries
- To find the inverse of a matrix, swap the values in a and d, and negate the numbers in b and c
