### Introduction

- The set is a cornerstone of maths
- Sets allow us to define collections of objects satisfying a property. Example: prime numbers. 
- A set is a **well defined** collections of objects. These objects are called **elements** and are said to be **members** of the set. 
- Well-defined - we are able to determine whether it is the set under scrutiny, avoiding sets based on opinion (e.g. the set of best footballers)

#### Notation and Set membership

- Capital letters (A, B, C) are used to represent sets and lowercase letters (a,b,c) are used to represent elements. 
- For set A, we write $\hat{x}$ if x is an element of A. For negation $\ddot{y}$ would mean that y is not a member of A.

- A set can be designated by listing its elements in set braces. A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
- Another standard for this set is A = {x | x is an integer and 1 £ x £ 5}. 
	- The vertical line may be read as "such that"
	- The symbols {x | ...} are read "the set of all x such that..."
	- The notation 1 £ x £ 5 is not an adequate description, unless we agree in advance that the elements under consideration are integers.
	- This is called specifying a universe, denoted by U
	- We will only consider elements from the universe when populating the set. 
	- If U was only considering even integers. The only elements would be 2 and 4. 
- Sets are often infinite, ellipses are used to represent a continuation of the sequence. 


#### Cardinality of Sets and Subsets

- For any finite set A, |A| denotes the cardinality, or size, of A. 
- This is sometimes denoteed n(A)
