### Introduction

- The set is a cornerstone of maths
- Sets allow us to define collections of objects satisfying a property. Example: prime numbers. 
- A set is a **well defined** collections of objects. These objects are called **elements** and are said to be **members** of the set. 
- Well-defined - we are able to determine whether it is the set under scrutiny, avoiding sets based on opinion (e.g. the set of best footballers)

#### Notation and Set membership

- Capital letters (A, B, C) are used to represent sets and lowercase letters (a,b,c) are used to represent elements. 
- For set A, we write x if x is an element of A. For negation y Ã¯ would mean that y is not a member of A.
