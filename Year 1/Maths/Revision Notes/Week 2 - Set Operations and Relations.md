- This section looks at operations which combine sets to give other sets, the way that mathematical relations are described using sets, and foundational problems with set theory that result in paradoxes.

#### Set Operations

- Union - Combine the elements of all the sets. 
- Intersection - Add only elements that appear in both sets.
- Symmetric difference - Add only elements that appear in one or the other, not both. (XOR)
