### Introduction

- The concept of a function is very important. 
- Functions also appear in programming. 
- Definition: For non empty sets, A and B, a function, or mapping, f, from A to B, denoted f: A r B, is a relation from A to B in which every element of A appears exactly once as the first component of an ordered pair in a relation. 

##### Examples

- If we consider the set of natural numbers, then square of N r N is a function mapping numbers in the familiar way. 
- Another way of writing functions is f(a) = b, when (a,b) is an ordered pair in the function f. 
- Thus square(a)=b contains the following ordered pairs: (0,0), (1,1), (2,4), (3,9)...
- This in more familiar notation is y = x<sup>2</sup>
