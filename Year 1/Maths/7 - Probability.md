- Probability is the mathematical modelling of likeliness of events occurring. 
- A simple way of looking at this is a toss of a coin
- Probability is measured on a scale of 0 to 1.
	- An event with 0 probability is an event that can never occur. Said to be impossible.
	- An event with 1 probability is said to be a certainty

How can we determine the probability of heads for a coin?

- One way of doing this is through observation. 
- We may toss a coin 1000 times and observe how many heads and tails there are.
- We may not obtain a perfect 50/50 split, but it should be something close. 
- If we obtain a result like 750/250, we may question the hypothesis. 
- The more observations made, the more reliable the result. 

Example

- Long term observations have determined that it rains in Bergen, on average, 285 days a year.
- Thus, the probability of rain on any given day is 285/365 or 78%


#### Probability Distributions and Sample Spaces

- The set of all possible outcomes of a given experement is called the sample space.
- If we consider the sample space to be a set, then a specific event is an element from the sample space.
- For example, the sample space of tossing a coin is {head, tail}, the probabilities of each element in the sample space must then add up to one. T
- This set of probabilities over a sample space is called a probability distribution. 
- A probability distribution for tossing a fair coin would be {0.5, 0.5}
