#### Basic Connectives and Truth Tables

- In the development of mathematical theory, assertions are made in the form of sentences.
- Such verbal or written assertions, called statements (or propositions) are declarative sentences that are either true or false - but not both. 
- For example, the following are statements, we use the lowercase alphabet to represent these.
	- p: Logic is a required subject for Computer Scientists
	- q: The moon is made out of green cheese
	- r: 2 + 3 = 5

- On the other hand, sentences such as:
	- Shut the door!
	- What a lovely evening!
	- I name this ship the "RMS Titanic"
- These do not have an obvious truth value.
- Other sentences are problematic because their truth value is subjective. 
	- e.g. He is well qualified for this position

- The statements represented by p,q,r are considered to be **primitive** statements, for there is no meaningful way of breaking them down into anything simpler. 
- New statements can be obtained from existing ones in two ways. 

1. Transform a given statement p into the statement Ã˜p, which denotes its negation and is read Not P
2. Combine two or more statements into a compound statement, using the following logical connectives.
	1. **Conjunction**: The conjunction of any statement p,q is denoted by p and q.
	2. **Disjunction**: The expression p or q denotes disjunction
