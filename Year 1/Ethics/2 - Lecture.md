**The ethical concerns of engineers**
- Military Use - Is my work going to used to kill people?
- Privacy - Is my work used to collect peoples personal location and information without their consent or to misuse their data without their knowledge. 
- Advertising - Am I contributing to spam? Am I inaccurately or unfairly classifying people for advertising purposes? Am I designing misleading or dishonest interfaces. 
- Surveillance - Is my work used to spy on workers or civilians? 


Other considerations

- Environmental Impact
- Causing unemployment
- Contributing to crypto scams
- Political manipulation
- Inaccessible software
- etc.

Common harms for technology users
- Dishonesty and untruth - the spread of false information about people, events, relationships, etc (e.g. gaslight, fake news).
- Harm and Hate - Trolling, cyber-bullying
- Discrimination - Racism, misogyny
- Manipulation - Using false information to sway people opinions
- Fraud - Phising, social maniupulation

How do engineers respond ethical concerns

Negotiation - Convincing decision-makers to take action by highlighting negative 
Feet voting - Refusing offers of employment, not applying for certain jobs, collective bargaining and tech worker boycotts
Refusal - Reducing one's productivity asking to be assigned to a different project, resigning


Resignation
- Engineers should not have to resign from their jobs, it should be used as a last resort.
- Engineers resign because they lose faith in their employers and feel powerless to change
- It is ineffective, a new developer is usually hired who agrees to do the questionable work. 
- Not everyone can resign, engineers on visas, or people who are financially unstable. 
- We need new ways of dealing with ethical concerns. 

"Grounded" Ethics

- A grounded perspective addresses ethics through real-world experiences and examples
- By "grounded" we mean understanding the implications of the systems we build, and considering the specific circumstances that surround them. 
- Grounded ethics implies that a concern for ethics and the societal impact of digital technologies is an integral and unavoidable part of software engineering professional practise. 
- A grounded ethics requires tools to help us think

Tools for grounded ethics

- Speculative ethics
- The FAPT (Fairness, accountability, privacy, transparency) framework
- Professional codes of conduct

# Speculative Ethics

- Speculation - using imagination to anticipate the potential benefits and harms of a technology
- Speculation helps you forsee the consequences of emerging technologies
- Speculation can help mitigate the negative outcomes of emerging technologies
- Conclusion can sometimes be that the technology should not be built at all

- Examples speculation:
	- What could go wrong with this technology?
	- What is something happened?
	- Could this technology be used to cause harm?
	- Why would society agree to use this technology?

Ethical example:

A dating site for cheating - Ashley Madison hack

# The FAPT framework

![[Pasted image 20250204120608.png]]

**Fairness**
- Our technologies must respect the dignity of individuals, and be consistent with the public interests. (Human rights, democratic values)
- Our technologies must not discriminate against certain individuals or social groups. 
- We must mitigate against biases the may influence our technologies outcomes. 
**Accountability**
- We must consider who is responsible for computing systems and their outcomes.
- There must be effective decision-making and oversight mechanisms for any technology. E.g. Who is responsible for the content that users publish on social media. 
**Privacy**
- Technologies must respect and safeguard the privacy of individuals
- Technologies must comply with privacy law (UK GDPR)
**Transparency**
- Actions, processes and data must be open to inspection by publishing information about the technology in a complete, open, understandable, easily accessible and free format. 
- Transparency supports accountability
- E.g. Show data that was used to train an AI model.

**Step 1: Who May Be Affected?**
- Consider who might be affected by the technology (stakeholders)
- Who might be affected positively?
- Who might be affected negatively?
- Look at this across all four dimensions (FAPT)
- Look across different scales (individuals, groups, governments, nations, natural environments, etc.)
**Step 2: What are the potential impacts?**
- What are the consequences of the technology for each of the stakeholders you indentified in step 1?
- How might their privacy, dignity and other rights be comprimised?
- Will they be prevented from accessing material resources?
- Will their reputation be damaged?
- Think short term, long term, local, global and environmental. 
- Consider historical factors / injustrices that may not be obvious. (racially or gender biased algorithms)
**Step 3: How can risk be addressed?**
- Whose expertise is needed to develop the technology (Accountability and fairness)
- Those most negatively affected by the technology should be involved in its design and making "Nothing about us without us"
- What alternative soloution address different stakeholder needs and impacts? (Fairness and privacy)
- Would greater transparency help? (Publishing how an algorithm works)

Advantages of the FAPT framework?
- Provides structure for ethical speculation?
- Can be applied to features and or whole products, services or applications. 
- Can be applied to existing, in-the-making and near-future technologies. 
- Can be applied to the past, to help us reflect on what went wrong and how harms could be avoided in future. 

# Professional Codes of Conduct

- We can't address ethical challenges along, several bodies and organisations provide guidance on ethical issues in software engineering practice. For example
	- British Computer Society (BCS)
	- Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)
	- Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)
- To be a member of any of these organisations, you agree to their code of conduct or code of ethics.

- However, **your judgement is still needed!**
- "These codes are not meant to serve as checklists, of how to be an ethical engineer in any given situation. Can only be achieved through the engineer's skillful, sincere and habitual practise of ethical reflection"
- Ethical codes are just one tool that help us "develop an eye" for what would be appropriate in various circumstances
- "Professional judgements are still nesseary. Good judgement is acquired through a combination of experience, good habits and conscious attention to ethical concerns"

**7 traits of "super professionals**

1) Strong sense of individual responsibility - Take ownership of your professional commitments and protect rights of your users
2) Acute awareness of the world around them - Understand the cultural and regulatory context your technology is embedded into
3) Brutal honesty - Confront lies and inaccuracies, and make decisions informed by facts
4) Resilience under pressure - Be true to your personal and professional beliefs, particularly when others ask you to violate them
5) Heightened sense of fairness - Understanding what is fair will help you mediate conflicts and make solid professional decisions. 
6) Attention to detail in maintaining perspective - Do not forget the overall nature and purpose of the technology being built
7) Pragmatism in applying professional standards. -  Understand that making technology involves trade-offs. Pick your battles, you cannot solve all the industry problems on your own. Take care of yourself, keep an eye on your stress levels and watch for burn out. 

- To survive in software engineering with any dignity and self-respect, you will need several of these 7 traits.
- They are essential for professionals. 

**Summary**

- Both users and engineers encouter ethical issues when building or interacting with technology
- The top ethical concerns of software engineers include military use, privacy, advertising and surveillance. 
- Responses of software engineers to ethical concerns include negotiation, feet voting and refusal. 
- Adopting "grounded ethics" can help you anticipate and prevent the negative implications and consequences of specific technologies. 
- Tools for grounded ethics include ethical speculation, the FAPT framework and professional codes of conduct. 
- Ethical speculation asks hypothetical questions to help us forsee the unintended consequences of technology. 
- The FAPT framework provides structure and direction for ethical speculation. 
- Professional codes of conduct contribute principles to guide our practise.
