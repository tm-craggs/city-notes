**The ethical concerns of engineers**
- Military Use - Is my work going to used to kill people?
- Privacy - Is my work used to collect peoples personal location and information without their consent or to misuse their data without their knowledge. 
- Advertising - Am I contributing to spam? Am I inaccurately or unfairly classifying people for advertising purposes? Am I designing misleading or dishonest interfaces. 
- Surveillance - Is my work used to spy on workers or civilians? 


Other considerations

- Environmental Impact
- Causing unemployment
- Contributing to crypto scams
- Political manipulation
- Inaccessible software
- etc.

Common harms for technology users
- Dishonesty and untruth - the spread of false information about people, events, relationships, etc (e.g. gaslight, fake news).
- Harm and Hate - Trolling, cyber-bullying
- Discrimination - Racism, misogyny
- Manipulation - Using false information to sway people opinions
- Fraud - Phising, social maniupulation

How do engineers respond ethical concerns

Negotiation - Convincing decision-makers to take action by highlighting negative 
Feet voting - Refusing offers of employment, not applying for certain jobs, collective bargaining and tech worker boycotts
Refusal - Reducing one's productivity asking to be assigned to a different project, resigning


Resignation
- Engineers should not have to resign from their jobs, it should be used as a last resort.
- Engineers resign because they lose faith in their employers and feel powerless to change
- It is ineffective, a new developer is usually hired who agrees to do the questionable work. 
- Not everyone can resign, engineers on visas, or people who are financially unstable. 
- We need new ways of dealing with ethical concerns.
