**What is a package is Java?**
- Java provides a large number of classes
- Keeping all classes in one folder can make them hard to access
- Java uses packages to arrange classes similar to how folders arrange files 
- Java API groups classes into packages according to functionality 

Example - java.io

When you do an import, you are telling Java to get that folder and bring those classes into the code. 

**Interfaces**

Abstraction - Reducing detail
The abstract keyword - Allows you to create a method with no content, designed as a placeholder. You must place a semi colon after an abstract method and not curly brackets. The same way you cannot have empty standard methods, you cannot have full abstract methods. 

**Java Collections Framework**

A collections framework is a unified architecture for representing and manipulating collections. 

In Java collections - the datatype cannot be a primative data type. 

Linked Lists - Each node holds the address of the next node in memory, can only traverse in one direction
Double Linked List - Each node holds the address of the next and previous node in 
This makes removing values easy, just change the pointer. 

**Sets**

Set - Similar to mathematical set, unorder with no reptition
Hash Table - When you use lists, you are looking for a special item. You nromally have to iterate over the complete list. This is expensive with large lists. 
A hash table can be much faster.

How does hashing work?

Like a dictionary, when you are looking for a certain
