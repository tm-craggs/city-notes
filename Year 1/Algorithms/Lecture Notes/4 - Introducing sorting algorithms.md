Recap - Simple sorting methods

Adaptive Sort - performs better on partially sorted inputs, and takes O)n time on sorted or almost-sorted inputs.

Stable sort - Preserves the relative ordering of elements that compare as equal. Keeping equal elements in the same order that they appear in the input. 


Selection sort - Compares values in turn, starting with the second value in the list. 

Insertion sort - Building an ordered sub-array on the left, expanding it by inserting each element from the unsorted portion into its appropriate place in the ordered sub-array.
