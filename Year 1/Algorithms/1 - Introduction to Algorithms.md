**Algorithms**

- There are many broadly similar definitions of an algorithm
- Informally, an algorithm is any well-defined computational procedure that takes some value, or set of values and produces a value, or set of values as an output. 
- An algorithm is thus a sequence of computational steps that transform the input into the output. 

**Pseudocode**

- Pseudocode is a plain text algorithm
- It is often ambiguous
- Pseudocode:
	- Abstracts away from specific programming languages
	- Describes sequential computations, with assignment, conditionals loops, and function calls.
