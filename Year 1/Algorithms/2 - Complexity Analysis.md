Recap: An algorithm is loosely defined as a sequence of computational steps transforming an input into output. 

- Comparing algorithms is a lot like buying a car, you have to weigh up numerous different factors such as performance, size, cost, etc.
- Algorithms are judged by their correctness, efficiency, simplicity.
- There are 2 types of complexity, time complexity and space complexity.
