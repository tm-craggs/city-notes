Recap: An algorithm is loosely defined as a sequence of computational steps transforming an input into output. 

- Comparing algorithms is a lot like buying a car, you have to weigh up numerous different factors such as performance, size, cost, etc.
- Algorithms are judged by their correctness, efficiency, simplicity.
- There are 2 types of complexity, time complexity and space complexity.
- When analysing and algorithm, we can look at average case complexity or worst case complexity.

**Average Case Complexity**
- Amount of some resource (typically time) used by the algorithm, averaged across all possible inputs. 

**Worst-case complexity**
- Guaranteed maximum resource for a given input size, the upper limit of the cost of an algorithm. 

**Big O notation**
- A mathematical way to represent worst case complexity. 
- Also called asymptotic computational complexity. 
- It ignores constant factors and smaller terms. 
- Simplifies the calculations and preserve the important information. 

**Tractability and Intractability**
- A problem is called intractable if there is **no efficient** algorithm that solves it.
