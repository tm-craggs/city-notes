There are three tools for expressing algorithms using loops

Loop invariants - For demonstrating partial correctness
Loop control variables - For keeping track of when to exit the loop
Order of Growth ("big O") notation - For measuring complexity, mainly worse case time

## Correctness

The first step is to distinguish between 2 types of correctness
