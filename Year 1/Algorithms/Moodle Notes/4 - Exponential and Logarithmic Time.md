- So far, we have only considered complexity functions O(1), O(n), O(n<sup>2</sup>), in general only O(n<sup>k</sup>)
- This session will look at other function that charactize other common agorithms. 

- **Exponential Time** - Very bad, typically found in algorithms that perform an exhaustive search. 
- **Logarithmic Time** - Very good, typically achieved by algorithms that cut the size of the problem each step.
