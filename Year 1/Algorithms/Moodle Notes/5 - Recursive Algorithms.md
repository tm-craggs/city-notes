- One strategy for solving problems is
	- If the problem is too big to solve directly, reduce it to smaller problems of the same type. 
	- Apply the same procedure to those.
- That is, the algorithm calls itself, it is recursive.
- This is used in fast sorting algorithms, but first we will review methods.

## Understanding Method Calls

- We'll begin with another look at methods,
