We should be familiar with
- Describing **regular languages** using **regular expressions**
- Recognising these languages using finite state machines. 

## Formal Languages

- General linguistics is hard. In Computer Science, we work with a simplified view of languages called "formal languages"
- We are only concerned with the surface structure of (syntax) of languages, not their meaning (semantics)
- Surface structure is a pre-cursor to meaning. 

**An Alphabet** - Usually written Σ is a finite set of symbols or letters.

Examples of alphabets:
Σbits = {0}
