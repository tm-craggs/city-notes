We should be familiar with
- Describing **regular languages** using **regular expressions**
- Recognising these languages using finite state machines. 

## Formal Languages

- General linguistics is hard. In Computer Science, we work with a simplified view of languages called "formal languages"
- We are only concerned with the surface structure of (syntax) of languages, not their meaning (semantics)
- Surface structure is a pre-cursor to meaning. 

**An Alphabet** - Usually written Σ is a finite set of symbols or letters.

**Examples of alphabets:**

Σbits = {0, 1}
Σdigits = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
Σletters = {a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, z}

**A string over an alphabet Σ** - A finite sequence of symbols from the alphabet Σ. 
- The set of strings over and alphabet Σ is written as Σ*
- The empty string is usually written ε (sometimes λ)

The symbols of a string are usually written together, without commas.

Although each string is finite, there are infinite many of them. Σ* is an infinite set
