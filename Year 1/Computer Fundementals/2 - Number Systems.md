# Positional Numb
- Numbers can be represented in any base
- Humans are used to base 10
- We can analyse numbers based on position and powers of 10.

- We should subscript number with their base, decimal numbers with 10 and binary numbers with 2

**Binary Numbers**
- Base 2 (binary) is usually used in computers
- The digits used in this base are 1 and 0
- A single binary digit is known as a bit


Example: Decimal Number vs Binary Number

Consider the number 13

Decimal:

Binary:

Follow the formula d x base

**Binary to Decimal Conversion**

1) Divide the given decimal number by 2, note remainder
2) Divided the obtained quotient by 2, note the remainder again
3) Repeat until 0 is the quotient
4) Write the remainders in such a way that the last remainder is written first, followed by the rest in reverse order. 
5) Result is the binary number of the given decimal

**Hexadecimal**
- Long binary numbers are hard to read
- Hexadecimal is base 16. Each digit can represent 4 bits. 
- Uses the characters 0123456789ABCDEF to represent decimal numbers 0..15 and binary numbers 0000 - 1111

**Octal**
- Octal is a number represented with base 8
- The octal representation uses the characters 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
- Each Octal character corresponds to three bits in binary
- Use same method as to convert decimal to octal as binary, but divide by 3
