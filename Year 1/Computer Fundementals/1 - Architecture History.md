**Early Devices** 
- Mechanical calculating machines (1642-1945) such as the Mechanical Calculating Clock
- Difference Engine and Analytical Engine - Charles Babbage
- Analytical Engine had many of the components of a modern computer, the mill (ALU), the store (memory) and input and output devices. 

**First Generation**: Vacuum Tube Computers (1945-53)
- These computers used valves and vacuum tubes to create logic circuits. 
- Very large, could take up entire rooms.
- ENIAC 1945 - The first general purpose, all electronic computer. 

**Second Generation:** Transistorised Computers (1955-65)
- Transistors replaced the vacuum tubes, could use electricity to create logic circuits. 
- Computers became smaller, faster and consumed less power.
- Still bulky and expensive
- Examples: IBM 7094, DEC PDP-1

**Third Generation:** Integrated Circuit Computers (1965-80)
- Integrated Circuits contained dozens of integrated transistors
- Integrated circuits were made of silicon, often called microchips
- Computers became faster, smaller and cheaper

**Fourth Generation:** Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Computers (1980-Present) 
- VLSI chips could have 10,000 components per chip
- 1981, IBM introduced the Personal Computer

**Modern Computers:**
- System on Chip (SoC) - All components of the computer are stored on one chip.
- New types of processors and memory, such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs)
- Laptops, smartphones, tablets and smart watches.

**Semiconductors**
- The most significant factor that allowed progress was the move to the use of semiconductors
- They are a type of material that can act as conductors or insulators.
- They switch between these two states under external control. 
- These can be used to create transistors that function as switches, this makes the basic logic of a computer. 
- Silicon is a semiconductor material that can be manufactured and processed efficiently and inexpensively
- This is why modern electronics are called "silicon chips"

**Moore's Law**
- Transistor count in Integrated Circuit chips will double roughly every 18-24 months. - Gordon Moore (1965)
- Moore's law predicts that this trend will continue into the foreseeable future. 
- Shrinking transistors have powered this trend, however we are reaching the limisr
