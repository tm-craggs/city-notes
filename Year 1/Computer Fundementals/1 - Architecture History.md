**Early Devices**
- Mechanical calculating machines (1942-1)


**First Generation**: Vacuum Tube Computers (1945-53)
- These computers used valves and vacuum tubes 
- ENIAC 1945 - The first general purpose, all electronic computer. 

**Second Generation:** Transistorised Computers (1955-65)
- Transistors replaced the vacuum tubes could use electricity to create logic circuits. 
- Computers became smaller, faster and consumed less power.
- Still bulky and expensive
- Examples: IBM 7094, DEC PDP-1

**Third Generation:** Integrated Circuit Computers (1965-80)
- Transistors became integrated into microchips
- Computers became faster, smaller and cheaper

**Fourth Generation:** Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Computers (1980-Present) 

**Modern Computers:**
- System on Chip (SoC) - All components of the computer are stored on one chip.
