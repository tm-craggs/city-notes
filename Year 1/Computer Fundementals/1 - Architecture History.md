**First Generation**: Vacuum Tube Computers (1945-53)
- These computers used valves and vacuum tubes 
- ENIAC 1945 - The first general purpose, all electronic computer. 

**Second Generation:** Transistorised Computers (1955-65)
- Transistors replaced the vacuum tubes could use electricity to create logic circuits. 
- Computers became smaller, faster and consumed less power.
- Still bulky and expensive
- Examples: IBM 7094, DEC PDP-1
