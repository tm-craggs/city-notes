Constraints can be added to the database to increase consistency throughout entries.

NOT NULL - If you specificy not null at the end of an attribute, this value cannot be left blank when a table entry is created. If you attempt to leave this blank, an error will occur.

UNIQUE - This means that the attribute content must be unique from all other table entries. 

DEFAULT - When declaring an attribute, if it is left blank during the table entry, the default attribute will be substituted for NULL. 

AUTO_INCREMENT - You can make an attribute that auto increments for each new entry. You then do not have to add it when making a table entry. This is useful for primary keys.
