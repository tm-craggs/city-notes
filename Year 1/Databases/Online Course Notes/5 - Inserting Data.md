INSERT INTO table VALUES(); allows you to create a table entryÂ 

The values in the brackets must be put in the same order as they are declared in the table.

SELECT * FROM student - Would get all entries into a table

You can choose to insert some values and leave others blank
INSERT INTO student(student_id, name) VALUES(1, Tom) would only insert values into student_id and name.
