# Boolean Algebra

- Boolean Algebra is a mathematical system for the manipulation of variables that can have one or two values
- In formal logic these values are "true" and "false" 
- In digital systems these are on or off, 1 and 0 or high or low
- Boolean expressions are created by performing operations on boolean variables
- Common boolean operators include and, or and not

**And & Or**

- A boolean operator can be described using a truth table
- And requires both inputs to be a 1 to return a 1
- Or requires only one
- The and operator is known as a Boolean product
- The or operator is the boolean sum

**Boolean Algebra and Digital Computers**
- Computers contain circuits that implement Boolean functions
- The simpler that we can make a Boolean function, the smaller the circuit
- Simpler circuits are cheaper to build, consume less power, and run faster than complex circuits. 

**The Hardware Hierarchy**
- Silicon -> Transistors -> Logic Gates
- Transistors and logic gates build:
- Computational Circuits
	- The output depends on the combination of inputs at that point
	- Total disregard to the past state of the inputs
	- Examples: functional units such as adders and subtractors
- Sequential Circuits
	- Outputs depend on a combination of both the present inputs as well as the previous outputs
	- Examples: Memory units

**Logic Gates**
- Boolean functions are implemented in digital computer circuits called gates
- A gate is an electronic device that produces a result based on two or more input values
- Gates consist of one to six transistors, but designers think of them as single units
- Integrate
