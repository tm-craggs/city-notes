**Evolution**

- Operating Systems have paralleled the evolution of computers.
- As hardware has become more powerful, newer operating systems allowed people to more easily manage the power. 
- In the early days, all OS could do was load, execute and terminate a program. 

**Operating Systems in the Personal Computer Era**

- PC operating systems are designed for ease of use
- The idea that revolutionised small computer OS was the BIOS (Basic Input Output System)
- BIOS takes care of details in handling peripheral devices and gets the OS started using a boot loader. 
- The boot loader starts automatically and loads the rest of th
