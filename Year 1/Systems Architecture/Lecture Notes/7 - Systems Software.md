# Operating Systems as Abstraction

- Operating Systems are the layer of abstraction of a computer system that sits in-between programs and hardware components. 
- Everything above the operating system is known as application software. 
- Applications do not interface directly with the hardware. They interface with the operating system. The operating system will interface with the hardware.
