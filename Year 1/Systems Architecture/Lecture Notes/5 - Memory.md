# Types of memory 

- When designing a memory system for computers, you want a system that is fast, large and cheap
- The problem with this is that typically, large memory is slow and fast memory is small and expensive. 
- For this reason, we must organise memory in a way that optimises the "average case"
- This is called **memory hierarchy**

The main types of memory are
- Cache memory
- Main memory
- Secondary memory
- Virtual memory

**Main memory**

- There are two kinds of main memory:
	- Random Access Memory (RAM)
		- Dynamic RAM (DRAM)
		- Static RAM (SRAM)
	- Read Only Memory (ROM)

**Dynamic RAM**

- A bit is stored in a capacitor
- DRAM consists of capacitors that slowly
