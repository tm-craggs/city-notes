**The overview of a simple computer**

Three main components
1) CPU
2) Main Memory
3) I/O Subsystem

The main operations of the CPU
- Processes instructions on data. 
- Reads from the input and writes the output. 
- Reads from and stores to memory. 
- Keeps track of what to do next

**CPU Basics**

- The two principle parts of the CPU are the Datapath and the Control Unit
- The Datapath consists of an ALU storage units (registers)
	- The ALU carries out logical and arithemetic operations as directed by the control unit
	- Registers hold data that can be readily accessed by the CPU. They can be implemented using D flip-flops. A 32-bit register requires 32 D-flipflops
- Various CPU components perform
