**Summary of Cache Formula:**

- Block Offset (offset field) = log2(bytes per block)
- Index (block field) = log2(number of cache blocks)
- Tag = Total address size - (b + i)

To perform log2 on a calculator, input log(x) / log(2)

Effective Access Time (EAT) = (cache hit rate * cache access speed) + (cache miss rate * main memory access speed)

Steps:
1) Find all rows that equal one, and write down the value of each letter
2) Not any letter which = 0, and add to the expression

For the reverse:
1) Write down all expressions given
2) Write down all the combinations of letters which would mean F = 1. Remember NOT statements. 
3) Analyse the options
