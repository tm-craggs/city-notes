Summary of Cache Formula:

- Block Offset = log2(bytes per block)
- Index = log2(number of cache blocks)
- Tag = Total address size - (b + i)

To perform log2 on a calculator, input log(x) / log(2)

Effective Access Time (EAT) = (cache hit rate * cache access speed) + (cache miss rate * main memory access speed)
