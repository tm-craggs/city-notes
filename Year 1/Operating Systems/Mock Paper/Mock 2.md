a)

Interrupts occur when waiting for I/O input, which can happen in many different scenarios. For example,

- Moving your mouse on screen. When the mouse is moved, an interrupt signal is generated by the I/O module for the mouse. The OS will then handle this input and will use position data from the mouse to position the cursor when it is rendered on screen. 
- Typing in a word-processor. The keyboard presses generate input singals by the I/O module connected to the keyboard. The interrupt handler for the keyboard will notify the application about which keys are pressed, so that the characters can be inserted. 
- When on a video call, I/O handler will continuously create interrupts for microphone and video inputs.

i) Base 8 as it can represent all values inclusive of 0-7
ii) 8<sup>3</sup> = 512

i) Three processes, fork is called twice from the main process, meaning there are three.
ii) fork is called twice by the same process, so there is only one parent process.
iii) There are two children, each one created by a fork() call. 
iv) The parent process and first child process all increment their copy of c, once. The second child increments it twice. 
v) The second child has value 2. 
vi) The parent process has value 1. 
vii) fork() is an API method that only the OS kernel can execute. Each time G calls fork() it causes an interrupt. 

b) Memory hierarchy are the different levels of memory pieces of data can be stored on a system. The top of the hierarchy is the fastest and usually has smallest capacity (L1 cache). The bottom of the hierarchy is the largest and usually slowest (HDD). Each type of memory has a trade off, so combining them attempts to create a well rounded system with speed, and capacity. For example, faster modules such as cache and registers are very fast, but significantly more expensive than slower modules such as RAM and hard disk, which are cheap. 

c) The principle of spatial locality is a phenomenon that when an instruction from memory is fetched, nearby instructions are also likely to be executed soon. 

d) The CPU spends a lot of time idle, waiting for instructions to be fetched from RAM. If the CPU were to get these items from cache, this time would be far lower. However, due to the cost of cache memory, it is impossible to have it large enough to store everything. As a compromise, we can benefit from spatial locality. When an instruction is executed, nearby instructions are buffered into cache memory just in case, as these instructions are naturally likely to be needed soon. This can help increase the CPUs hit rate, and thus speed, as more instructions it needs can be fetched from higher up in the memory hierarchy.

a)

Step 1: Work out how many seconds it takes to transfer the process (without latency)
8.2 MB / 108.4 MB/s = 0.07564 seconds. 

Step 2: Convert transfer to milliseconds by multiplying by 1000.
0.07564 x 1000 = 75.645

Step 3: Convert the latency time from nanoseconds to milliseconds by dividing 1000
7.3 / 1000 = 0.0073

Step 4: Multiply this time, and the latency time by 2, as the process is swapped in, and then out
75.645 x 2 = 151.29
0.0073 x 2 = 0.0146

Step 5: Add the two together for Context Switching Time
151.29 + 0.0146 = 151.30 ms

b)

A single level directory file system is a simple way of organising files. All files, from all users will be stored in one single directory. This is very limiting, as files can never be given different names across a whole system, and there are no sub-directories. This means files cannot be grouped in any way. A more effective way of organising files is by using a tree structure, where folders can contain files as well as other folders. Files can have the same name as long as they are located in different folders. 

c) 631, 254, 007

d) A method of virtual memory management. Can bring a page into memory only when needed. If a page is not in memory, it is considered page fault and then the mage is brought from memory to memory. This is known as a lazy swapper - it never swaps a page into memory unless the page is needed.
