# Operating Systems

- A program or collections of programs that controls the execution of application programs. 
- An interface between applications and hardware. 

Main objectives of an OS

- System efficiency, reliability and security
- Ability to add new system functions without interfering with services provided by the system. 

What services does an OS provide?
- Program development

An OS is a big deal!
- A CPU can only do one thing at a time, but we want to run lots of programs at the same time, without interfering with each other
