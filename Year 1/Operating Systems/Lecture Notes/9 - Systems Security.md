## Computer Security Overview

- Computer Security is defined as
	- "The protection afforded to an automated information system in order to attain the applicable objectives of preserving the integrity, availability and confidentiality of information system resources"
- Preserving integrity, availability and confidentiality is known as the CIA Triad

##### **Key Security Concepts**

- **Confidentiality**
	- Preserving authorised restriction on information access and disclosure
	- Including means for protecting personal privacy and proprietary information
- **Integrity**
	- Guarding against improper information modification or destruction
	- Including ensuring information non repudiation and authenticity
- **Availability**
	- Ensuring timely and reliable access to and use of information

##### The Security Problem

- System secure if resource used and accessed as intended under all circumstances
	- This is unachievable
- **Intruders** attempt to breach security
- **Threat** is potential security violation
- **Attack** is attempt to breach security (accidental or malicious)
- Easier to protect against accidental than malicious

##### Security Violations

- **Breach of confidentiality**
	- Unauthorised reading of data
- **Breach of integrity**
	- Unauthorised modification of data
- **Breach of availability**
	- Unauthorised destruction of data
- **Theft of service**
	- Unauthorised use of resources
- **Denial of Service (DOS)**
	- Prevention of legitimate use. 

## Problems: Security Violation Methods

##### Some Computer Security Challenges

- Computer Security is not as simple as it might seem
- Potential attacks on the security features must be considered
- Procedures used to provide particular services are often counter intuitive
- Physical and logical placement needs to be determined
- Additional algorithms or protocols are usually needed on top of what may be provided by the functional requirements of the system
- Attackers only need one weakness, developers need to find all weaknesses
- Users and system managers tend not to see the benefit of security until a failure occurs
- Security requires constant monitoring
- Security is often an afterthought incorporated into a system after the design is complete. 

## Actions to Mitigate the Problems

- Impossible to have absolute security, but make cost high enough to deter attackers to easier targets
- Security must occur at 4 levels to be effective

**Physical**
- Data centres, servers, connected
