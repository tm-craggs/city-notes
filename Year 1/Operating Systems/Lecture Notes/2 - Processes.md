Today's questions

- What happens when a program's execution is interrupted
- How does the OS interleace the execution of multiple programs
- How does the OS ensure new processes are not waiting while the CPU is idle? 
- How can limited RAM be shared among interleaved processes. 
- What does a process look like to an OS

## "Interrupting" processes

Interrupt
- Cause: External to the execution of the current instruction. 
- Use: Reaction to an asynchronous external event. 

Trap
