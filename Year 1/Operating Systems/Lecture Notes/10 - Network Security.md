## Introduction to Networks

##### Networks and distributed systems

- Computers are inter-networked and must communicate and cooperate
- Networks allow the exchange of information between hosts through a series of applications that are ruled by a series of protocols
- The information exchanged by the hosts together with other control messages are transmitted through a large variety of access media that interconnect many intermediate devices. 

##### The internet

- Devices = hosts. They are a series of very different devices connected to "the internet"
- Each device (hosts/end systems) needs to connect through some media
- One physically connected, a route between devices is established through a series of links and packet switches (it is not always fixed)
- The information is transported through packets, and a series of protocols (HTTP, FTP, SMTP, TCP...) make the transmission possible.
- Alternatively, the internet is an infrastructure that provides services to applications 
- In the end, all that matter is the exchange of information, but the information is embedded with a lot of other information in a complex way. 

##### Layers, Services, Interfaces, Entities, Protocols and Models

- A set of protocols is called a network architecture. The definition of layers form a model.
