## Goals and Principles of Protection

- A computer consists of a collection of objects
- Each object has a unique name and can be accessed through a well-defined set of operations
- Protection problem - ensure that each object is accessed correctly and only by those processes that are allowed to do so

- Protection involves controlling the access of processes and users to the resources defined by a computer system
- The processes in an operating system must be protected from one another's activities
- To provide this protection, we can use various mechanism to ensure only processes that have authorisation from the OS can operate on files, memory, CPU, networking and other system resources
- These mechanisms must provide a means for specifying the controls to be imposed, together with a means of enforcement. 

- Protection was originally designed for multiprogramming systems to let untrustworthy users safely share resources, like memory. 
- Over time protection mechanisms have evolved to improve the reliability of systems, especially ones connected to the internet. 
- Protection links heavily with [[7 - File Systems#File Sharing]]

**Principles of Protection**

- The guiding principle is the **principle of least privilege**
	- Programmes, users and systems should be given **just enough privileges** to perform their tasks
	- Limits damage if entity has a bug, or gets abused
	- Can be static or dynamic
	- Static - During life of system, during life of process
	- Dynamic - Changed by process as needed by domain switching or privilege escalation

**Least Privilege**

- Consider one of the tenets of UNIX - A user should not run as root
- Most users respect that, fearing an accidental delete operation of which there is no undo
- Because root is virtually omnipotent, the potential for human error when a user acts as root is grave, and its consequences can be far reaching. 
- Now, consider rather than human error, damage may result from malicious attack. A virus launched by a click for example, or a buffer overflow or other code injection attack that is successfully carried out against a root-privileged process. 
- These could affect all users if run as root. 

## Protection through Domains

**Domain Structure**

- Access-right = `<object-name, rights-set>` where rights-set is a subset of all valid operations that can be performed on the object. 
- Domain = set of access-rights

**Domain Implementation (MULTICS)**

- Multics (Multiplexed Information and Computing Service) was an early time-sharing OS.
- Let `Di` and `Dj` be any two domain rings
- If `j < i` -> `Di âŠ† Dj`
- A process executing in domain `Dj` has more privileges than a processes executing in domain `Di`
