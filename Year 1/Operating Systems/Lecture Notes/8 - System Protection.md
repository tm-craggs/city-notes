## Goals and Principles of Protection

- A computer consists of a collection of objects
- Each object has a unique name and can be accessed through a well-defined set of operations
- Protection problem - ensure that each object is accessed correctly and only by those processes that are allowed to do so

- Protection involves controlling the access of processes and users to the resources defined by a computer system
- The processes in an operating system must be protected from one another's activities
- To provide this protection, we can use various mechanism to ensure only processes that have authorisation from the OS can operate on files, memory, CPU, networking and other system resources
- These mechanisms must provide a means for specifying the controls to be imposed, together with a means of enforcement. 

- Protection was originally designed for multiprogramming systems to let untrustworthy users safely share resources, like memory. 
- Over time protection mechanisms have evolved to improve the reliability of systems, especially ones connected to the internet.
