# Quantitative Performance Measures

**User Oriented**
- Response time - Time between when the process arrives in the ready queue and when it is assigned to the CPU for the first time. 
- Turnaround time - Time between when the process arrives in the ready queue and when it finishes executing. 

**System Oriented**
- Throughput - The number of processes that start and complete during the duration of observing the system (the time between when the first process arrives and the last process terminates)
