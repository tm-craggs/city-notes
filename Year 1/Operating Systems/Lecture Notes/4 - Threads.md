# Quantitative Performance Measures

**User Oriented**
- Response time - Time between when the process arrives in the ready queue and when it is assigned to the CPU for the first time. 
- Turnaround time - Time between when the process arrives in the ready queue and when it finishes executing. 

**System Oriented**
- Throughput - The number of processes that start and complete during the duration of observing the system (the time between when the first process arrives and the last process terminates)
- Wait time - For each process, the total time the process spends waiting to be assigned CPU
- These definitions assume no overhead in the creation of a process, and negligible time taken to admit processes to the ready queue.

## Arrival and Service Times

- Processes A B and C are admitted into the ready queue by the long term scheduler
