## Background and Introduction

- Memory wish list:
	- Private
	- Infinitely large
	- Infinitely fast
	- Non-volatile (holds data when turned off)
	- Inexpensive
- This is obviously not possible, but gives an idea about what we try to achieve with Computer Memory
- This is why memory hierarchy exists, as different types of memory are good at achieving different things. For example:
	- **Cache Memory** - Fast, but small and expensive
	- **Solid State** - Slow, but large, cheap and non-volatile
	- **Main Memory** - Middle ground, decent speed and price, but is volatile
