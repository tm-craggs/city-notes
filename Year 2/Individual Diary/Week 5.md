## Week 5 overview

February 23rd - March 1st
**Note:** This weeks diary ends at February 27th, due to the week 5 deadline for first deliverables. 

Week 5 was spent correcting some final errors in our work, before consolidating everything we had done into the final write up. 

## Second Group Meeting (February 23rd)

On Monday 23rd of February, in place of our regular team meeting, we had a productibe meeting with the entire group. 

Attendees: Tom, Anu, Abdullah, Fariah and members from other teams

The purpose of this meeting was to agree on our final component diagram and names for interface methods.
- Each team have pitched their component diagrams, we picked the one we thought was clearest out of the three groups, and corrected some final errors with input from all teams.
- We discussed how we would agree on names for common interfaces. Each team would send the names of methods they needed from other teams, which would then be implemented in both teams class diagrams to maintain consistency across IPOS. 
- This was also a good opportunity for everyone in the group to see each teams most up to date class diagrams. There was a lot of explanations and feedback across groups. 


## Final Write Up

As project manager, it was my job to make sure I had all the latest versions of every-bodies work, and use this to write up the final document for submission.
