## Week 3 overview

February 9th - February 15th 

Week 3 saw the group begin its work on the first deliverables, after agreeing on the division of work at our team meeting. 

## Team Meeting (February 9th)

Attendees: Tom, Anu, Fariah, Neil, Rached

During this meeting, we divided the tasks between the group so we could begin work for the first deliverables deadline on 27th. Work for this this deadline consists of

- Use Case Diagram
- Use Case Specifications
- Component Diagram
- Class Diagram
- Java Code and Test Case Generation

The tasks were allocated as follows. Anu and Fariah will work on the use case diagram, Rached and Abdullah will work on the Component and Class diagrams, Neil and Tharun will focus on generating test cases for the interfaces. 

I will primarily be helping Rached and Abdullah with the component and class diagrams, but I would also help the others with any concerns or trouble that would come up. I will also be writing the final submission document, and will be reviewing and offering any feedback for the completed work before giving it the go ahead. 

We also worked through a couple of technical problems we were having with shared documents on the team drive, and helped a few members of team 33 who did not have access to the group Discord server during this meeting. 

# Group Meeting (February 12th)

On February 12th, I attended our first Group 11 meeting along with a few members of my team. This meeting was mostly spent getting to know other team members,  and their role in their team. We also had some brief, early discussions with Team 32s design team about interfaces between our subsystems and agreed to further discussion about a naming convention for interfaces.


## Consultant Meeting (February 12th)

**Note:** Consultant meetings were moved from Friday weekly to Thursday weekly from this point

I attended our second consultant meeting. This meeting was spent clarifying a few points on Use Case Diagrams and Specifications. We were also reminded of the time pressure of getting the diagrams done, so I set an internal deadline for the group which was to have a first draft for the Use Case and High Level Design tasks before our next team meeting, where we could review the work together.
