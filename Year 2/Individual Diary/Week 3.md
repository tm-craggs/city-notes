## Week 3 overview

February 9th - February 15th 

Week 3 saw the start of our work on the first deliverables. 

## Team Meeting (February 9th)

Attendees: Tom, Anu, Fariah, Neil, Rached

During this meeting, we divided the tasks between the group so we could begin work for the first deliverables deadline on 27th. Work for this this deadline consists of

- Use Case Diagram
- Use Case Specifications
- Component Diagram
- Class Diagram
- Java Code and Test Case Generation

The tasks were allocated as follows. Anu and Fariah would work on the use case diagram, Rached and Abdullah would work on the Component and Class diagrams, Neil and Tharun would focus on generating test cases for the interfaces. 

I would primarily be helping Rached and Abdullah with the component and class diagrams, but I would also help the others with any concerns or trouble that would come up. I would also be writing the final submission document, and would be reviewing and offering any feedback for the completed work before giving it the go ahead. 

We also worked through a couple of problems we were having with shared documents on the team drive, and helped a few members of team 32 who did not have access to the group Discord server during this meeting. 

# Group Meeting (February 12th)

On February 12th, I attended our first group 11 meeting along with a few members of my team. This meeting was mostly spent getting to know other team members, getting to know them and their role in their team. We also had some brief, early discussions with Team 32s design team about interfaces between our subsystems and agreeing to further discussion about common names for interfaces. 



## Consultant Meeting (February 12th)

**Note:** Consultant meetings were moved from Friday weekly to Thursday weekly from this point

I attended our second consultant meeting. This meeting was spent clarifying a few points on Use Case Diagrams and Specifications. We were also reminded of the time pressure of getting the diagrams done, so I set an internal deadline for the group which was to have our completed Use Case Diagram and Specifications before our next team meeting, where we could review the work together.
