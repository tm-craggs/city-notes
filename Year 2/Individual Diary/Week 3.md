## Consultant Meeting (February 12th)

**Note:** Consultant meetings were moved from Friday weekly to Thursday weekly from this point

We were also reminded of the time pressure of getting the diagrams done, so I set an internal deadline for the group which was to have our completed Use Case Diagram and Specifications before our next team meeting, where we could review the work together.
