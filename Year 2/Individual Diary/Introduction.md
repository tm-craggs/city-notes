This is the individual diary for **Thomas Craggs**. 

I am keeping this diary weekly, at the end of each week I will document important meetings, events, and communications. 

I am using **markdown** to keep this diary, and each weeks diary entry is being stored in a separate file, all inside a root folder. named "diary". To simplify submission and marking of the diary by staff, each weeks entry has been merged into **one PDF**.
