## First Team Meeting - 1 hour

At our first team meeting, a few things were discussed. We had. 

-  A quick ice breaker, to get to know names and their strengths and weaknesses.
-  Role assignment, after this we discussed which roles. We decided on the following:
	- Project Manager: Tom
	- Deputy Manager: Anu
	- System Analysts: Anu, Neil, Tharun
	- Designers: Rached, Fariha, Abdullah
	- Programmers: Rached, Fariha, Abdullah, Tom
	- Testers: Neil, Tharun


-  Technical discussion - We decided that we would use Java for any programming. It is a language we are all responsibly comfortable as we had used it in Year 1. Java also lends itself well to Object Oriented Programming, which would be used heavily throughout the project. 
-  We agreed to make this meeting a regular date, every week we will meet up to discuss the project. 
-  We agreed we would use Notion for the team binder, the Deputy Manager was assigned the Job to have it set up. 
- We set up a GitHub repository for future programming collaboration. 

#### Reflection


## Mr Lancaster Interview

Me and Anu attended an interview with Mr Lancaster on Tuesday. Here is a sample of question and answers which were received.



Q: What type of security scope is needed for the prototype? Is it enough to just demonstrate functionality or should we include security features?
A: Just demonstrating functionality is enough. 

Q: Do you want any additional discount plans or just the ones specified in the brief?
A: No - only the fixed and flexible discount plans are required. 

Q: Would like more clarification on the discount plans. Who assigns discount plans, and how long do they last? Can they change? can they have none?
A:

Q: How are accounts restored from "in-default" back to normal? 
A: There is a special account for the company director that has this functionality

Q: At what point do you define "low stock conditions" when sending a low stock warning, how is this calculated?
A: Each item in the catalogue has its own "low" value, the notification is triggered when stock falls below this number.


How is the first admin account created?

	Hard code in a backup account, admins can create other admins.

4. Do you need a GUI to interact directly with IPOS-SA, if so what do you expect from the GUI. 
5. Who gets notified when stock falls below minimum?

Function that allows for quick generation of list of all items which are below stock. No notification. 

7. When an order is placed, does stock reduce instantly or after dispatch?

How much history should we keep for the report, when is the cutoff?
Everything

How should the three teams products come together?
They do need to communicate, all programs can be run on one laptop, or we will need to agree how we will do it online. 


Can simulate third party payments

Stock should go down when order is placed. Should go back if the order is cancelled. Invoice can be raised when shipped. 

Any orders before suspension will be honoured, suspension is on new orders.
