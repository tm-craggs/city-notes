## Team Meeting - 1 hour

At our first team meeting, a few things were discussed. We had. 

-  A quick ice breaker, to get to know names and their strengths and weaknesses.
-  Role assignment, after this we discussed which roles. We decided on the following:
	- Project Manager: Tom
	- Deputy Manager: Anu
	- System Analysts: Anu, Neil, Tharun
	- Designers: Rached, Fariha, Abdullah
	- Programmers: Rached, Fariha, Abdullah, Tom
	- Testers: Neil, Tharun


-  Technical discussion - We decided that we would use Java for any programming. It is a language we are all responsibly comfortable as we had used it in Year 1. Java also lends itself well to Object Oriented Programming, which would be used heavily throughout the project. 
-  We agreed to make this meeting a regular date, every week we will meet up to discuss the project. 
-  We agreed we would use Notion for the team binder, the Deputy Manager was assigned the Job to have it set up and keep it maintained. 
- We set up a GitHub repository for future programming collaboration.

## Mr Lancaster Interview - 1 Hour

Me and Anu attended an interview with Mr Lancaster on Tuesday. All questions and answers from our team are recorded below. 

**Q**: What type of security scope is needed for the prototype? Is it enough to just demonstrate functionality or should we include security features?
**A**: Just demonstrating functionality is enough, no need to encrypt user data for the prototype. 

**Q**: Do you want any additional discount plans or just the ones specified in the brief?
**A**: No - only the fixed and flexible discount plans are required. 

**Q**: Would like more clarification on the discount plans. Who assigns discount plans, and how long do they last? Can they change? can they have none?
**A**: Merchants choose their discount plan, they can choose either flexible or fixed, or have none. They can change their discount plan, and the differences must be counted<sup>1</sup>.

**A**: Keep everything, there is no cutoff where history is deleted.

**Q**: How should the three teams products come together in the system demonstration
**A**: All three subsystems must communicate. You can demonstrate them all on one laptop, 

**Q**: How are payments being handled?
