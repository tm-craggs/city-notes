## Team Meeting (February 16th)

Attendees: Everybody

At this group meeting, with the entire team present, we began cross-checking each others work. I reviewed the Use Case Diagram and specifications that had been worked on by Anu and Fariah. Although it had not been completely finished and polished yet, I was very happy with the results so far, as were other members of the team. 

However, the situation with the High-Level design and class diagrams was more difficult. We had first draft work that we felt got the general gist, but we had a lot of areas where we were still quite unclear. and had errors. We set out the next consultant meeting as a good opportunity to ask questions and get some of these issues ironed out. 


## Consultant Meeting (February 20th)

Our consultant meeting this week had been cancelled due to our consultant being sick. However, we still needed support for our High-Level Design and Class Diagram. I decided to organise an online meeting with Peter Popov as a substitute. 

This meeting was extremely helpful, we were shown example diagrams and talked through them. Peter helped us clarify the 2 interfaces for our subsystem that we would have to model, and helped us clarify a few more minor points, such as if our diagram required ports.
