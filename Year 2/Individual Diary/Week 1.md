# First Communication (January 26th)

I was the first person to make contact with the rest of Group 31. I did not know anyone in my group already, I decided to send the first message on the Moodle discussion form, hoping to set up easier, more permanent discussion.

Responses started coming in quickly, over the next few days we would have everybody from our group in the WhatsApp chat. 

On the chat, I asked people when they were free and arranged a time and place for our first team meeting, I also booked a study room.

# Discord Server (February 1st)

On February 1st I was invited to a Discord server for the entirety of group 11.
