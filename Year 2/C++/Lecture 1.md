**About C++**
- Everything in C++ has to be a class, fully object oriented. 
- `<iostream>` is one of the most common system headers
- g++ compiler
- For loops are the same as Java
- To reference a `#include` system header, call it and use a double colon. E.g. `std::cout<<"Hello World"`. This is called a scope resolution. 
- This references the standard name space, and calls the `cout` function. 
- To avoid typing it over and over, define it as a namespace at the start of your file. 

```c++
using namespace std



```

- Every function must have a return value. Most functions are defined with an integer return value. Returning 0 means success.
