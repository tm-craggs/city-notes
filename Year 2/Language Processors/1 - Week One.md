What the course is about

- Programming languages is about programming languages as order of study
- This course is about grammars, parsers, interpreters, compilers
- We will be using Java to implement a compiler 

Key Words
- Grammar - Defining the syntax of a language
- Parser - A program which checks the syntax of source code and builds its abstract syntax tree
- Interpreter - A program that executes other programs
- Virtual Machine - A program that executes low level code (interpreter)
- Compiler - A program that translates programs written in a high-level language into low-level code

- The JVM is a program which executes java byte code
- More generally, a VM is an interpreter for a low level language
- We will be implementing a small high-level language (LPL26) by compiling to Simple Stack Machine (SSM) code.
