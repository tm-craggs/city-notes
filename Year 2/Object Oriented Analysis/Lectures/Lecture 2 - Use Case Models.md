#### Basics of Use Case Modelling

- Use Case Modelling is a form of **requirements engineering**
- Use case modelling proceeds as follows
	- Find the **system boundary** 
	- Find actors
	- Find use case (use case specification, scenarios)
- It lets us identify, **who** or **what** uses the system, and **what** functions the system should offer.
