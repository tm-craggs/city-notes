#### Part 1 - Basics of Use Case Modelling

###### Objectives

Introduce use case modelling and the UML Use Case Diagrams
- System Boundaries
- Actors
- Use Cases
	- Main and alternative flows
	- Controlling the flow
		- Branching with "if" repetition with for and while
- Relationship between use cases and actors
- Requirements tracing

###### Use Case Modelling

- Use case modelling is a form of **requirements engineering**
- Use case modelling proceeds as follows
	- Find the **system boundary**
	- Find actors
	- Find use cases
		- Use case specification
		- Scenarios

It lets us identify the system boundary, **who** or **what** uses the system, and **what** functions the system should offer.

###### The Subject

- Before we can build a system we must know
	- Where the boundary of the system lies
	- Who or what uses the system
	- What functions the system should offer to users

We create a Use Case model containing
- Subject - the edge of the system (system boundary)
- Actors - who or what uses the system
- Use Cases - things actors do with the system
- Relationships
