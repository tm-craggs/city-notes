## Time Complexities

**Sorting**

Bubble Sort 
Average/Worst: O(n<sup>2</sup>)
Best: O(n)
Space: O(1)

Insertion Sort
Average/Worst: O(n<sup>2</sup>)
Best: O(n)
Space: O(1)

Merge Sort
All cases: O(n log n) 
Space: O(n)

Heap Sort
All Cases: O(n log n)
Space: O(1)

Quick Sort
Average O(n log n)
Worst O(log n)
Space O(log n)

Bucket
Average/Best: O(n + k) where n is output and k is number of buckets
Worst: O(n+k)
Space: O(n+k) or O(n) if k is proportional to n

**Searching**

Linear Search
Best: O(1)
Average/Worst: O(n)
Space: O(1)

Binary Search
Time: O(log n)
Space: O(1)

Breadth/Depth First Search
Time: O(V + E)
Space: O(V)
*Where V is the number of vertices (nodes) and E is the number of Edges (connections between vertices*

**Abstract Structures**

Singly Linked List
Access by index: O(n)
Search: O(n)
Insert at head: O(1)
Insert at tail: O(n)
Delete at head: 
Delete at position: O(n)


Priority Queue

Stack



## Definitions

Node/Vertex - A unit representing an entity or an object
Edges (links) - A connection between nodes
Binary Tree - A tree where each node has at most 2 children
Root - The node with no parent
Leaf - A node with no children
Perfectly Balanced Tree - A tree who's least deep leaf is no more than one level apart from the deepest leaf
Heap - A binary tree that satisfies the **Heap Property**
Heap Property - A perfectly balanced **binary tree** such that **no node is larger than its parent** and **all items on the lowest level are far to the left as possible**
