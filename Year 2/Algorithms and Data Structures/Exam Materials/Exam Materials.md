## Time Complexities

**Sorting**

Bubble Sort 
Average/Worst: O(n<sup>2</sup>)
Best: O(n)
Space: O(1)

Insertion Sort
Average/Worst: O(n<sup>2</sup>)
Best: O(n)
Space: O(1)

Merge Sort
All cases: O(n log n) 
Space: O(n)

Heap Sort
All Cases: O(n log n)
Space: O(1)

Quick Sort
Average O(n log n)
Worst O(log n)
Space O(log n)

Bucket
Average/Best: O(n + k) where n is output and k is number of buckets
Worst: O(n+k)
Space: O(n+k) or O(n) if k is proportional to n

**Searching**

Linear Search
Best: O(1)
Average/Worst: O(n)
Space: O(1)

Binary Search

Breadth First Search

Depth First Search

**Abstract Structures**

Singly Linked List

Priority Queue


## Definitions

Binary Tree - A tree where each node has at most 2 children
Root - The node with no parent
Leaf - A node with no children
Perfectly Balanced Tree - A tree who's least deep leaf is no more than one level apart from the deepest leaf
Heap - A binary tree that satisfies the **Heap Property**
Heap Property -
