## Performance Measures

**User Oriented** - From the perspective of a user or process

Response Time - The time between when the process arrives in the ready queue and when it is assigned to the CPU for the first time

Wait Time - Response Time + any additional delays

CPU burst time - Total time the process needs to spend running on the CPU

Turnaround Time - Time between when the process arrives in the ready queue and when it finishes executing. 

**System Oriented** - From the perspective of the system as a whole

Throughput - The number of processes that start and complete during the duration of observing the system

Wait time - For each process the total time the process spent waiting to be assigned to the CPU. 

All these assume negligible overhead in creating and admitting of processes
